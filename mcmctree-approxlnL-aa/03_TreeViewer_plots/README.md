We will use `TreeViewer` ([Bianchini and SÃ¡nchez-Baracaldo, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10873)) to plot the distributions that we have gotten for our analysis with the aim to provide a visual comparison. There may not be time to demonstrate how to use this graphical interface, but there is no problem because everything is explained in great detail on [the `TreeViewer` Gitub Wiki page](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer/wiki/Plotting-multiple-age-distributions) -- the guidelines are very clear and easy to follow, hence there is no need to rewrite them here :)

I have provided you with [example `tbi` files](tbi_files) (i.e., `TreeViewer` files that contain the tree topology together with all the modules, attachments, attributes, and other transformations carried out to design the figure that displays our timetrees) so that you can open them and further inspect once you install `TreeViewer` on your PCs. The main advantage of having `tbi` files is that you can keep reusing the modules and attributes that are responsible for the main design of the figure. Then, you just need to add the new input files that you will use to draw the distributions on every node generated with other models, replace the old distributions in modules/attributes... And you are ready to go!
